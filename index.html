      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Madhav—a second-year Computer Science major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a passion for technology and its real-world impact. I began my college journey at Virginia Tech, and since transferring to UMass, I've been able to blend my strong technical foundation with a growing interest in machine learning and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly excited about using software development and ML-driven insights to solve practical problems and build meaningful tools. My approach to computer science is rooted in creating innovative, user-focused solutions that make a difference beyond the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, you'll often find me shooting hoops at the local basketball court or enjoying a bike ride to reset and recharge. I'm always open to meeting new people and exchanging ideas—let's connect!

          <div class="card-title">Movie Recommendation Project</div>
          <div class="card-subtitle">Python • Machine Learning</div>
          <p>
            A machine learning–based recommendation engine that utilizes collaborative filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences. Users interact with the system by swiping left or right on movie cards, indicating dislikes and likes respectively. The model is trained on two primary datasets—movies and user ratings—and currently achieves an impressive RMSE of 0.87 and MAE of 0.67.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project features a dynamic frontend interface that visually presents the movie options and captures user feedback in real time. While the core model is fully functional, frontend development is ongoing to enhance user experience. Meanwhile, model tuning and optimization continue to ensure personalized, accurate recommendations for each user.

          <p>
            At TensorDock, I contributed to enhancing the company's GPU infrastructure by streamlining cloud GPU deployment processes, which led to a 50% improvement in deployment efficiency. In addition to backend optimization, I played a key role in redesigning TensorDock's landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, helping improve both functionality and user experience. I also conducted extensive testing and debugging in a production environment to identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations, ensuring a more stable and responsive platform for end users.

          <p>
            Over the course of 200+ hours, I have worked in various roles including after-school counselor, day-care counselor, and beach attendant. In my roles as a counselor, I led children from kindergarten through sixth grade in both after-school and summer programs, focusing on promoting their well-being, growth, and development. I consistently worked to create a positive, inclusive, and safe environment where every child could feel supported and thrive. These experiences strengthened my ability to communicate effectively, lead with empathy, and adapt to the diverse needs of young learners.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a beach attendant, I was responsible for overseeing the operation and cleanliness of Westford's public beaches. This included enforcing safety regulations, monitoring beachgoers, and ensuring that all facilities were well-maintained and compliant with town standards. The role required attention to detail, quick decision-making, and a strong sense of responsibility to maintain a safe and welcoming environment for the community.
